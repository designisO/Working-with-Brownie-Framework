# Working with Brownie Framework

Today I was able to start the learnings of the Brownie Framework. Brownie allows developers to create, deploy and test smart contracts on their local machine.

Topics that I was able to cover today were the following: 

- Installed Solidity Plugin (PyCharm)
- Brownie init
- Brownie bake token
- Brownie Compile
- Brownie Gui
